HELLO! Welcome to Subscribe: A morning pages React app

For now, I am using this README to keep track of everything I have done so far, as a sort of log of what has worked, and what breaks (things will inevitably break.)

2/4/2025:
I used npm to install React and set up the initial application. I ran into an issue with a dependency not being installed - it was "web-vitals". Installing this manually into the subscripe-app directory resolved the error message.

I also installed Bootstrap for React with npm. I am choosing to develop with Bootstrap to simplify the process of making my application responsive to differing screen sizes, since this is a core value of my design philosophy with this application (being accessibility).

So far, npm start is resulting in a develoment build that is compiling fully. Ok, nice!

In terms of next steps, I will create the front end design of this application, without entirely thinking about form submissions and user authentication.

Currently working on front end design of this application:
For page routing, I had to manually install "react-router-dom"
